# Loop
Replacement for setInterval using CSS transition delays and event listeners.

As well as emulating a setInterval Loop allows for easy slowing down of the loop to a point where it stops similar to the slowing down of a slot machine.

There is some example markup in the index.html and a simple initialisation in init.js.

The loop can be started with:

```
loop.go();
```

And stopped with:

```
loop.stop();
```
